Hello! I'm currently pursuing my Master of Computer Applications (MCA) and I'm passionate about technology, especially MERN stack development and problem-solving. As I explore and learn in these fields, I enjoy creating dynamic web applications that make a difference.

In addition to my tech interests, I am deeply invested in spirituality and Yoga, which help me stay balanced and focused. These practices enrich my personal and professional life, providing a holistic approach to everything I do.

Let's connect and share insights on tech, mindfulness, and more. Together, we can build something great!
